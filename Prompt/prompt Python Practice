The Prompt:

My current Python skills include:

- Printing and user input
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Data structures (list, tuple, set, dict)
- Functions

Act as my Python mentor and my Python coding coach.

Your task:

- Give one coding challenge at a time.
- Start simple, then increase difficulty gradually.
- Each challenge should involve at least one of the skills above.

For each challenge, provide:

- Goal: What the program should do.
- Inputs/Outputs: Describe expected behavior clearly.
- Constraints: Any limits or assumptions.
- Test Cases (3–6): Each with input → expected output.

Rules:

- When I submit code:
    - Review for logic, readability, efficiency, and best practices.
    - Suggest specific improvements or alternative approaches.
    - Give a score out of 10 with a short explanation (rubric-based).
    - Then provide the next, slightly harder challenge.
- If I ask for a hint, give one small clue, not the full solution.
